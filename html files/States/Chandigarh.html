                    Nestled at the foot of Shivalik Hills, Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh paints a pretty picture. Stretching
                    for a distance of 3 sq. km., Sukhna Lake is a man-made lake and is the only one of its kind in the
                    city created in the year 1958 by damming the seasonal Sukhna Choe (Stream) that flows down the
                    Shivalik Hills. With its pristine blue water, the lake serves as a perfect location for a stream of
                    morning joggers and walkers who can also enjoy the fresh air. In fact, the architect of Chandigarh -
                    India's first planned city - Le Corbusier claimed that this lake would be the centre of wellness
                    pursuits for the residents.
                    <br><br>
                    The promenade in front of the lake is frequented by walkers and joggers who carry out their exercise
                    regimes here. Moreover, it also has one of the longest rowing channels in the country that host the
                    Asian Rowing Championships. The best way to enjoy a tour of the Sukhna Lake is to go on a lazy
                    boating tour on it. You can hire a boat for an individual or for a couple, which would cost you
                    between INR 50 - INR 100.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from serving as a delight for artists and photographers, the lake is also a great spot for
                    sports activities such as rowing, trampoline jumping along with the recent addition of a Solar
                    Cruise. It is home to several species of fish and migratory birds such as Siberian ducks and cranes.
                    Bounded by a golf course and the famous Rose Garden, the lake offers a mesmerizing escape to its
                    visitors at all times of the day.
