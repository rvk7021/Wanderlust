                <p class="value">Virtually an island that resembles the shape of a tortoise, Kutch is an erstwhile
                    princely state of India holding onto its grandeur nature from the past. Kutch is probably one of the
                    most beautiful, yet surreal places in India with the vast expanses of the white salt desert. The
                    place comes to life during the winters when the Rann Festival is held during December-February
                    everywhere in which there are huge camp settlements with cultural programs, functions and adventure
                    activities like hot-air ballooning.
                    <br><br>
                    Kutch is also among the largest district of India with a terribly low population density. Also,
                    Kutch lies on the India-Pakistan border and you can see parts of Pakistan from Kutch. Kutch is also
                    famous for crafts and embroidery works, Flamingo Sanctuary and Wild Ass Sanctuary. Bhuj is an ideal
                    starting point to visit the Rann of Kutch. Beautiful beaches of Mandvi near Bhuj are also totally
                    worth visiting during your trip to Kutch. Don't miss to see the ancient town of Dholavira.

                    artificial lake. The project was carried out by a Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust
                    (SVPRET) which was established for this purpose.
                    <br><br>
                    The magnanimous Statue is designed by the Indian Sculptor, Padma Bhushan awardee Ram Vanji Sutar.
                    The construction of the final product was taken up by the Indian company Larson & Toubro and the
                    total project was estimated to have cost 3000 Crore INR (420 million USD).
                    <br><br>
                    The Iron needed for the project was supposed to be collected from the used farming equipment from
                    farmers all around the nation, who were the most cared by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. Due to some
                    problems, nearly 5000 tonnes of iron collected was used for a different part of the same project but
                    not the statue.
                    <br><br>
                    Along with the project in progress, SVPRET's Statue of Unity Movement organised the Suraaj Petition
                    which included the ideas for good governance by the people and resulted in becoming the world's
                    largest signed petition. These were some of the other essential features of the project.

                    Located on the western tip of the Saurashtra peninsula in Gujarat, Dwarka is believed to be the
                    capital city of Lord Krishna's kingdom. Known as Devbhoomi Dwarka, Dwarka boasts of being the only
                    city that is a part of both Char Dham (four principal holy places) and also Sapta Puris (seven
                    sacred cities) mentioned in the Hindu religion. Dwarka was a part of the ancient kingdom of Krishna

                    Rani Ki Vav or 'Queen's Stepwell' is a distinctive form of water storage system located in the small
                    town of Gujarat called Patan, on the banks of River Saraswati. Believed to be the grandest stepwell
                    in the state of Gujarat, Rani ka Vav epitomises the peak of Maru-Gujarat architectural style. The
                    900-year-old structure listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site is displayed prominently in the new ₹
                    100 currency note issued by the Reserve Bank of India.
                    <br><br>
                    In the olden days, the water of the well had medicinal properties which helped ward off diseases
                    like viral diseases and fever. The well was excavated in the 1960s in a well-protected state as it
                    was buried under slit for sanctuaries. In addition to this, Rani Ka Vav was an important centre for
                    socializing among the locals as well as taking refuge from the heat. It's an excellent example of
                    turning something functional into a piece of art.
                    <br><br>
                    The unique stepwell was constructed from 1063 to 1068 AD in Chalukya Dynasty as a memorial of
                    Bhimdev Solanki by his widowed Queen Udaymati. It is designed in the shape of an inverted temple,
                    divided into seven levels, highlighting the sanctity of water. Apart from being a water storage
                    system, Rani Ki Vav is also known for its intricately carved sculptures on pillars that numbers
                    around eight hundred primarily based on the theme of Lord Vishnu.
                    <br><br>
                    It is believed that Rani ka Vav was commissioned by the widowed queen Udaymati in the fond memory of
                    her husband Bhimdev I (AD 1022 to 1063), son of Mularaja, the founder of the Solanki dynasty of
                    Anahilwada Pattan. The construction started around 1050 AD and was probably completed by Udayamati
                    and Karandev I after the death of her husband.
                    <br><br>
                    One can find the reference of Udayamati building the monument in the 'Prabandha Chintamani' composed
                    by Merunga Suri in 1304 AD. Later, the vav was flooded by River Saraswati located nearby and silted
                    over until the 1980s. It was then that Archaeological Survey of India excavated it along with its
                    carvings in pristine condition. Today, considered as a man-made marvel, Rani ki Vav is among the
                    finest stepwells in the legacies of the ancient capital city of Patan.
