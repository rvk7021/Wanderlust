       Built in 1746, it was intended as a residence for the Peshwa. Many additions were made after the fort was constructed such as the gates, court halls and more. 
        It was once a huge seven-storied structure but most of it was burnt down in a fire in 1828. One of the attractions of Shaniwar Wada is the many gates, each known by a name.
        There is also a gate known by the second wife of Peshwa Bajirao, Mastani.

       A visit to these historical places will give you an idea about the history of state, about the legacy of Shivaji and Peshwas,     the stamp left by the British and 
       Indians’ resolve to protect and cherish these pieces of history for posterity.
