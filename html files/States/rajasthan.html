            The Chittorgarh Fort is one of the most notable attractions in Chittorgarh. The pride of the Rajasthani town is this old fort, which sits imposingly on the summit of a hill and looks down protectively over the city. <br><br> Almost all of Chittorgarh’s attractions are housed within the fort.
             The Chittorgarh Fort is a large structure that dates back to the 7th century and covers approximately 700 acres. <br><br>
             Chitrangad, the Mori Rajputana prince, built this ancient site in Udaipur, Rajasthan. It is India’s largest. 
             The fort commemorates the majestic architecture, historic Rajputana history, and terrible sieges and jauhars. <br><br>
             In 2013, at the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Chittorgarh Fort, along with five other forts of Rajasthan, 
             was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as a group called the Hill Forts of Rajasthan. <br> <br>
             The fort that once boasted of 84 water bodies has only 22 of them now. These water bodies are fed by natural catchment and rainfall, and have a combined storage of 4 billion litres that could meet the water needs of an army of 50,000.
              The supply could last for four years. These water bodies are in the form of ponds, wells and step wells

            The magnificent Umaid Bhawan Palace, also known as the ‘Chittar Palace,’ was built in 1943 to provide jobs for the area’s poor, 
            drought-stricken farmers. In the present, this location serves as both a museum and a historic hotel, presenting the ideal balance of an appealing present and a spectacular past. <br><br>
            Umaid Bhawan Palace is one of the most beautiful historical places in Rajasthan. Umaid Bhawan Palace is one of the world’s largest private residential residences, with 347 rooms. <br><br>
            The Palace is divided into three functional parts – the residence of the royal family, a luxury Taj Palace Hotel, and a Museum focusing on the 20th-century history of the Jodhpur Royal Family. <br><br>
            The palace was built at a slow pace as its initial objective was to provide employment to the famine-stricken farmers in the area. The foundation stone was laid in 1929. About 2,000 to 3,000 people were employed 
            in its construction.[3] Occupation of the palace by the Maharaja came after its completion in 1943, and close to the period of Indian Independence. There was some criticism for embarking on an expensive project but it had served the main purpose of helping the citizens of Jodhpur to face the famine situation. <br><br>
            The estimated cost of building the palace was Rs 11 million.[4] When it opened in 1943 it was considered one of the largest royal residences in the world.

            Junagarh Fort is a fort in the city of Bikaner, Rajasthan, India. The fort was originally called Chintamani and was renamed Junagarh or "Old Fort" in the early 20th century when the ruling family moved to Lalgarh Palace outside the fort limits. <br><br>
            It is one of the few major forts in Rajasthan which is not built on a hilltop.The modern city of Bikaner has developed around the fort.
            <br><br>
            The fort complex was built under the supervision of Karan Chand, the Prime Minister of Raja Rai Singh, the sixth ruler of Bikaner, who ruled from 1571 to 1611 AD. Construction of the walls and associated moat commenced in 1589 and was completed in 1594.
             It was built outside the original fort of the city (the first fort built by Rao Bikaji), about 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) from the city centre. Some remnants of the old fort are preserved near the Lakshmi Narayan temple. <br><br>
             Historical records reveal that despite the repeated attacks by enemies to capture the fort, it was not taken, except for a lone one-day occupation by Kamran Mirza. Kamran was the second son of the Mughal Emperor Babur who attacked Bikaner in 1534, which was then ruled by Rao Jait Singh.[6]
            <br><br>
            The 5.28 hectares large fort precinct is studded with palaces, temples and pavilions.[2] These buildings depict a composite culture, manifest in the mix of architectural styles.
