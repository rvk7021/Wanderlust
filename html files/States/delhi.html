                Also known as Lal Qila, Red Fort was brought to life by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, in 1639. Since then, it had been the regal residence of numerous Mughal emperors who enjoyed a royal stay in this magnificent fortress-palace during their reign in Delhi. <br><br>
                The fort derives its name from the red sandstone used in building its fortified walls. Today, Red Fort is not only a tourist site thronged by millions every year but also the chief venue of the country’s Independence Day celebrations, where the Prime Minister hoists the flag and addresses the citizens. History has it that the fort was once decked with several artworks and jewels, all of which were plundered during Nadir Sha’s invasion. 
                <br><br>Yet, this massive structure still remains as the most prized jewel in the list of India’s heritage sites.

            If on the one hand, Delhi consists of astounding forts, on the other, it is dotted with beautiful mausoleums housing the tombs of great emperors who were instrumental in shaping Indian history. Humayun’s Tomb, also called Maqbara e Humayun is no less than an architectural splendor, although it is a monument with the tomb of the great Mughal emperor Humayun.
            <br><br> Designed by two Persian architects in the famous charbagh layout, it is one of the first and finest garden tombs in the country, which also inspired several other monuments, including Taj Mahal.  Another interesting fact about this mausoleum is that it was commissioned and supervised by none other than Humayun’s bereaved wife, Bega Begum, in 1570.

            This fort is famous for two things. First, it is one of the oldest forts ever built in Delhi (5000 years old) and second, it is the spot of the death of Mughal emperor Humayun who slipped from the stairs of his library and succumbed to the injuries. <br><br>
            Purana Qila, which literally means Old Fort, is more of a boundary wall around which the city was built and has fortifications that are as tall as 20 meters with a thickness of four meters – indeed an impenetrable wall. 
            <br><br>The light and sound show conducted here walks you through the history of this lesser known fort that traces its origins to the 16th Century. Apart from this show, one can even opt for a refreshing boat ride in the outskirts of the fortress.
