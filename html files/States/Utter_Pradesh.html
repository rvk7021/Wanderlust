                <p class="value">One of the seven wonders of the world, Taj Mahal is located on the banks of River
                    Yamuna in Agra. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife,
                    Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. Constructed entirely out of white
                    marble in the 17th century, Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful monuments in the world. Every
                    year visitors numbering more than the entire population of Agra pass through the magnificent gates
                    to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking monument!
                    <br><br>
                    A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Taj Mahal stands for the Crown of Palaces in the Persian language.
                    The tomb is laid out in a rectangular shape and can be approached through a massive gateway which
                    has an arch and alcoves on either side of it. There are water channels and fountains in the entrance
                    which makes the monument even more spectacular. The reflection of this majestic spectacle in the
                    Yamuna is almost poetic in its perfection!
                    <br><br>
                    Covering an area of approximately 42 Acres, the construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1631 and it
                    took 17 years before it was completed in 1648! It was constructed using white marble obtained from
                    Makrana in Rajasthan.

                <p class="value">Located at a distance of 40km from Agra, Fatehpur Sikri is a town in the Agra district
                    and a famous tourist attraction. A city predominantly made of red sandstone, Fatehpur Sikri was
                    founded in 1571 century by Mughal Emperor Akbar. It is essentially a fortified city built by the
                    king and had been the capital of his Empire for fifteen years. Now a UNESCO world heritage site, it
                    is home to Jodha Bai's Palace, Jama Mosque, Buland Darwaza, and Tomb of Salim Chisti among many
                    other famous monuments. Derived from Arab and central Asian tent encampments, the Imperial Complex
                    is a work of pavilions arranged in formal geometry on a piece of land.
                    <br><br>
                    A unique blend of architectural excellence, as well as religious beliefs - sums up Fatehpur Sikri.
                    It was built by Akbar to honour Sheikh Salim Chisti, whose prediction of the birth of a Mughal heir
                    came true while Akbar was visiting the then city of Sikri. In honour of the prophecy, Akbar built
                    this city and Jama Masjid, a stunning mosque which is still in use today. He also undertook the
                    construction of three palaces for each of his favourite wives, one a Hindu, one a Muslim and one a
                    Christian. An Indo-Islamic Masterpiece, Fatehpur Sikri look its resplendent best during sunset.

                    Akbar in 1573. It is located on the right bank of the River Yamuna and is made entirely of red
                    sandstone. The historical fort was once the ersthwhile residence of the Mughals until 1638. One of

                    Also known as Lal –Qila, Fort Rouge or Qila-i-Akbari, Agra Fort is a symbol of Agra and is so
                    massive that it is often referred to as a walled city. It is the perfect example of Mughal art and
                    architecture, built purely out of red sandstone. Within the premises of Agra Fort lie the most

                    is the spiritual capital of India. It is one of Hinduism's seven holy cities. The old city of
                    Varanasi lies along the western banks of the Ganges, spread across a labyrinth of narrow galis. Be
                    prepared to walk on foot and encounter some holy cows! Temples at almost every turn engulf Varanasi
                    but the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is the most visited and the oldest of the lot. Benaras is known as
                    the city of Lord Shiva for a reason, and rightfully so.
                    <br><br>
                    Varanasi is considered an auspicious place to die, as it is believed to grant moksha or liberation
                    from the cycle of life and death. Spiritually enlightening, the heart of the city pulsates around
                    the ghats, about 80 of which border the Ganges. Be prepared for the sights, sounds and smells! Don't
                    miss out on the hot chaat and cool lassi. Though, all chaos and noise on the ghats take a pause
                    before dusk when the Ganga Aarti begins to take place, a ceremony of immense grandeur.
                    <br><br>
                    This divine city is also an important destination for Buddhists. Gautam Buddha preached his first
                    sermon in Benaras, a part which is now in Sarnath.

                    Often referred to as the "Baby Taj Mahal", the tomb of Itimad-ud-daulah is a Mughal mausoleum and
                    often regarded as a copy of the Taj Mahal. This is the first tomb in India made entirely of marble.
                    The tomb was commissioned by Nur Jahan, the wife of Jahangir, for her father Mir Gheyas Beg (later
                    known as Itimad-ud-daulah), who was a minister in the court of Shah Jahan.
                    <br><br>
                    The tomb of Itimad-ud-daulah marks the transition from the first phase of the Mughal architecture to
                    the second. This was the first structure to make use of pietra dura and the first to be built on the
                    banks of the Yamuna River. It basically consists of Indo-Islamic architecture, with the use of
                    arched entrances and octagonal shaped towers. If you take a bird's eye of Itimad-ud-daulah Tomb, it
                    looks like a jewel box set in a garden. This magnificent mausoleum, built on the banks of Yamuna,
                    was to inspire the construction of one of the wonders of the world "Taj Mahal" in the later years.

                    Akbar himself oversaw the construction of this tomb until his death. Unlike the other tombs of

                    Following Tartary traditions, that state that one must see-through the construction of one's tomb
                    themselves, Akbar lived through the construction of his tomb and built a beautiful garden around it.

                    One of the oldest cities on the banks of Yamuna, Vrindavan is considered to be one of the most important places of pilgrimage for the devotees of Krishna. It is said that Lord Krishna had spent his childhood in Vrindavan. The name of the city has been derived from Vrinda (meaning basil) and van (meaning grove) which perhaps refer to the two small groves at Nidhivan and Seva Kunj. Since Vrindavan is considered to be a sacred place, a large number of people come here to abandon their worldly life.
                    <br><br>
                    The city of Vrindavan hosts hundreds of Lord Krishna and Radha temples scattered throughout, the most famous ones being Banke Bihari temple and the world-famous ISKCON temple. The vibrant surroundings perfectly depict the playful and benevolent nature of Lord Krishna. Located along the waters of River Yamuna, the numerous temples set amidst the thick woods and lush greenery of Vrindavan are the major attractions here.

                    The capital and the largest city of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, situated on the banks of river Gomti,
                    welcomes you with a heartwarming note of "Muskuraiyein, kyunki aap Lucknow mein hai". A city of
                    kebabs and nawabs, of architecture and history, of literature and culture – that is Lucknow in a
                    nutshell for you. From a slice of rich colonial history to modernized museums, this artistic hub of
                    Awadh region beautifully brings together the opulence of a glittering past and the simplicity of a
                    modern city.
                    <br><br>
                    Rumi Darwaza, the Mughal Gateway built in the centre of the capital divides Lucknow into 'Old
                    Lucknow' which is ancient, and more crowded, and the 'New Lucknow' which is urban and one of the
                    most planned cities of Asia. Most of Old Lucknow is well-known for its bustling vibrant streets,
                    authentic, mouth-watering kebab and biriyani outlets, lakhnavi chikan market, and the wholesale
                    jewellery stores.
                    <br><br>
                    New Lucknow, on the other hand, hosts people of varied cultures and is structurally planned with
                    wide roads, shopping malls and parks built to serve diverse entertainment purposes. The most famous
                    among these parks are the Ambedkar Park and the Gomti Riverfront Park, both ideal places for
                    visiting and strolling around with friends and family in the evening.
                    <br><br>

                    Hazratganj have a distinct Victorian architecture, and you can shop for literally anything –
