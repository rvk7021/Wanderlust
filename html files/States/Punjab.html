                <p class="value"> One of the most spiritual places in India, the Golden Temple, also known as Sri
                    Harmandir Sahib, is
                    the holiest shrine in all of Sikhism. Located right in the heart of Amritsar, the stunning golden
                    architecture of the temple and the daily Langar (community kitchen) attract a large number of
                    visitors and devotees each day. The temple is open to devotees of all faiths and serves over 100,000
                    people free food from all walks of life.
                    <br><br>
                    The main Temple housing the shrine is a small part of the vast complex known as Harmandir Sahib or
                    Darbar Sahib to the Sikhs. The spiritual focus is the tank, the Amrit Sarovar, which surrounds the
                    glistening central shrine. Around the edges of the compound, there are more shrines and monuments.
                    The Sikh Museum is located inside the main entrance clock tower which shows the oppression endured
                    by the Sikhs at the hands of the Mughals, the British and the Indian Government of 1984. The
                    Ramgarhia Bunga is a protective fortress located at the southeast end of the tank and is surrounded
                    by two Islamic-style minarets. Golden Temple is indisputably one of the most exquisite attractions
                    in the world.

                    Located at a distance of 22 km from Lahore, Pakistan and 28 km from Amritsar in India, the Wagah
                    Border marks the boundaries between Indian and Pakistani borders, running along the Grand Trunk
                    Road. The Wagah Border Ceremony or the Beating Retreat Ceremony, held every day, is the prime
                    attraction. Every evening, just before sunset, the soldiers from the Indian and Pakistan military
                    meet at this border post to engage in a 30-minute display of military camaraderie and showmanship.
                    <br><br>
                    This ceremony includes the closing of the international gates and lowering the flags of both
                    countries. The flag ceremony has been conducted by the Indian Border Security Force and Pakistan
                    Rangers since 1959.
                    <br><br>
                    People also partake in entertainment as a display of national pride for the thousands of people who
                    come here every day. During the build-up to the ceremony, the crowd engages in chanting the Indian
                    national anthem, rounds of applause and Bollywood-style dancing on Hindi songs.

                <p class="value">Located near the famous Golden Temple of Amritsar, Jallianwala Bagh is a public garden
                    that also houses a memorial to commemorate the massacre of peaceful celebrators by the British
                    forces. Spread over 6.5 acres of land, Jallianwala Bagh is associated with one of the saddest days
                    in Indian History when thousands of innocent people were killed on the orders of General Dyer as
                    they gathered for a peaceful celebration of Baisakhi. The place has now been turned into a beautiful
                    park and is managed by the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust.
                    <br><br>
                    There is a memorial tablet at the entrance which serves as a record of history. The tragic incident
                    left a deep scar on the country, and a memorial was constructed post the independence for the
                    innocents who lost their lives in this devastating incident. Established by the government of India
                    in 1951, the massacre memorial was inaugurated by Dr Rajendra Prasad on 13th April 1961.
                    <br><br>
                    A number of structures are present inside the premises which resound of the atrocities that occurred
                    here. These include a wall which still bears the marks of the bullets that were hurled blindly at
                    the civilians and a well in which many people jumped to save themselves from the onslaught of the
                    bullets. It is estimated that over a 1000 Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs lost their lives in this brutal
                    assault. a narrow alley of immense historical importance passes through here. An air of eerie calm
                    still lingers over the Jallianwala Bagh and gives one a feeling of indescribable sadness and peace.

                    <br><br>
