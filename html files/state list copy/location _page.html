               <p class="value">Virtually an island that resembles the shape of a tortoise, Kutch is an erstwhile princely state of India holding onto its grandeur nature from the past. Kutch is probably one of the most beautiful, yet surreal places in India with the vast expanses of the white salt desert.  The place comes to life during the winters when the Rann Festival is held during December-February everywhere in which there are huge camp settlements with cultural programs, functions and adventure activities like hot-air ballooning. 

                Kutch is also among the largest district of India with a terribly low population density. Also, Kutch lies on the India-Pakistan border and you can see parts of Pakistan from Kutch. Kutch is also famous for crafts and embroidery works, Flamingo Sanctuary and Wild Ass Sanctuary. Bhuj is an ideal starting point to visit the Rann of Kutch. Beautiful beaches of Mandvi near Bhuj are also totally worth visiting during your trip to Kutch. Don't miss to see the ancient town of Dholavira.</p>

       Built in 1746, it was intended as a residence for the Peshwa. Many additions were made after the fort was constructed such as the gates, court halls and more. 
        It was once a huge seven-storied structure but most of it was burnt down in a fire in 1828. One of the attractions of Shaniwar Wada is the many gates, each known by a name.
        There is also a gate known by the second wife of Peshwa Bajirao, Mastani.
